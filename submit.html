<button class="button2"><b>Food:</b>Pet needs food like human as it gives energy. Food is vital for any pet, but it should also be taken into
 consideration that giving any food is not enough.<br>
<b>Water:</b>Aside from giving your pet food, water should also be provided. This is always the pair of the food and a pet can survive a day without a food but not with water.<br>
<b>Love:</b>The need for friends,both human friends and animal friends.<br>
<b>Shelter:</b>Yes, shelter is also a basic need. Do not just let your pet lie anywhere under the scorching heat of the sun or the freezing cold of the night.<br>
<b>Exercise:</b>Exercise is not only done by pet owners; your pet needs it too! Exercise is needed by pets to be healthy and alert, just like humans.<br>
<b>Socialize:</b>Pets need to socialize, too. They are happy when they are around other animals though they sometimes get aggressive, but mostly, they enjoy the     other animalâ€™s company. </button>
